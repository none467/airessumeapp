Upgrade the existing Gradio-based AI Resume Builder app into a visually stunning, world-class website that looks and feels like a $100K+ professional SaaS platform. The final design should be smooth, animated, responsive, and feel like a top-tier website from Apple, Stripe, or Linear.

## GENERAL DESIGN GOALS:
- Ultra-clean interface with elegant spacing and balance
- Responsive mobile-first layout
- Subtle motion on every user interaction
- Gradient overlays, glassmorphism, soft shadows, and premium icons
- Visual hierarchy and intuitive flow

## VISUAL STYLING:
1. **Fonts & Typography**
   - Use Google Fonts: `Poppins` (headers), `Inter` or `DM Sans` (body)
   - Font smoothing and consistent line height
   - Heading animations with fade-slide effect

2. **Color Scheme**
   - Use modern, soothing gradients:
     - `linear-gradient(135deg, #00C6FF 0%, #0072FF 100%)`
     - `linear-gradient(to right, #434343, #000000)` (dark mode)
     - Accent colors: Neon Blue `#00e0ff`, Cyber Purple `#a100ff`, Silver White `#f5f7fa`
   - Light/Dark mode toggle with animated transition

3. **Button Styling**
   - 3D glassmorphism buttons with hover glow & click ripple
   - Smooth transitions using `transition: all 0.4s ease-in-out`
   - Keyframe animation for call-to-action: pulse or bounce on load

4. **Card & Section Layouts**
   - Use neumorphism-style cards:
     - Soft shadows, depth using `box-shadow: 0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)`
     - Rounded edges, padding, hover elevation
   - Responsive grid layout for features & dashboard sections

5. **Animations & Transitions**
   - Use `@keyframes` for fade-in, slide-up, and pulse effects
   - Entry animation on each section using AOS or custom CSS (IntersectionObserver)
   - Animate button clicks, form inputs, and file upload feedback

6. **Hero Section**
   - Full-screen hero with animated gradient background
   - Welcome message with typing animation or scroll parallax
   - Floating resume & AI icons in background using Lottie or SVGs

7. **Chatbot Interface**
   - Modern, rounded chat UI with smooth auto-scroll
   - Typing indicator animation with dots
   - Chat message fade-ins with delay for realism

8. **Interactive Effects**
   - On keypress inside form inputs → subtle highlight animation
   - On hover over sections → scale up slightly with shadow glow
   - Click sound or haptic feedback effect (optional)

9. **Download & Success Feedback**
   - Toast notifications for "Resume Generated", "PDF Downloaded"
   - Include confetti or particle animation for success events

10. **Advanced CSS Setup**
   - Embed all styles using `css=` in Gradio blocks
   - Use embedded `<style>` for custom transitions
   - Reusable `.btn-primary`, `.card`, `.gradient-bg`, `.input-animated` classes
   - Include Lottie JSON animation embeds via HTML if needed

## TECHNOLOGIES:
- Python backend (Gradio)
- HTML/CSS for frontend design in Gradio `Blocks`
- Google Fonts CDN
- Optional: AOS.js or custom Intersection Observer animations
- Optional: Include `lottie-web` for animated icons or loaders

Make the interface **smooth, professional, futuristic**, and ensure it performs well across devices. Structure the layout to guide users step-by-step through resume building, analysis, job matching, and chatbot. Add hover effects, input animations, and ensure UI/UX flow is intuitive and engaging.

Ensure full compatibility with Replit, including responsive scaling and animated transitions inside `gr.Blocks()` layout.
